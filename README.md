# enigma-simulator

This enigma-simulator project is a tool which simulates the
workings of an [Enigma machine][wiki-enigma], the Germans' main military
encryption tool during World War II. The software allows users to
encrypt and decrypt messages. Additionally, the simulation includes a
step-by-step guide how to recover Enigma keys.

This project is based on [National Security Agency][nsa] demo.
